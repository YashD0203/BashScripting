# Bash Scripting 


Bash scripting, short for "Bourne Again Shell" scripting, is a powerful and versatile way to automate tasks and perform various operations in a Unix-like operating system. It allows you to create scripts composed of commands and logic, enabling you to streamline repetitive tasks, manage files, process data, and more, all from the command line.
